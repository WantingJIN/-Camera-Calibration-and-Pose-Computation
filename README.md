# Camera Calibration and Pose Computation
The goal is this project is to perform camera calibration and pose computation by using virtual servoing. 
By trying to minimize the error between the estimate point coordinates with respect to the real coordinates, the Interaction matrix of the camera can be estimated. Then, this matrix is used to estimate the pose of the camera. For more details, please read the subject of the project.

This project is the lab for the Vision for the robot course in ECN(Ecole Centrale de Nantes). The framework of this project is provieded by the professor Olivier Kermorgant, you can visit his gitub page to download the initial code.
